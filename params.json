{"name":"Trip","tagline":"Low coupling module development","body":"# tRip - Low coupling module development\r\ntRip intent to be a practical and lightweight tool to provide modularity and low coupling on your source code.\r\n\r\n### Main Features\r\ntRip was designed to:\r\n- Take care of Singleton's and Stateless' services for your\r\n- Allow you to create modules and extensions to your software without change one LOC in the core implementation\r\n- Fast warm-up: tRip already knows what to provide in compilation phase, there's no need to look into the entire class-path for provided classes\r\n- Zero configuration: just let the [ServiceProvider](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Getting-Started:-My-First-Modular-App) run the software for you\r\n- Factory-based creation of services: you can take control of how a service is provided creating your own factory\r\n- Manually provided data: you still can provide data manually to your software context.\r\n\r\n### Low footprint\r\ntRip is basically two jars:\r\n- trip-core ( 30kb ): which is needed to run your application\r\n- trip-processor ( 28kb ): which is responsible by the auto discovery of Singleton's and Stateless' services on your modules. This dependency is needed only during compilation phase.\r\n\r\n### Lets get started?\r\nHere is a little tour of tRip main features.\r\n- [Configuring a project with tRip](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Configuring-a-project-with-tRip)\r\n- [My First Modular App](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Getting-Started:-My-First-Modular-App)\r\n- [Understanding ServiceProvider](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Undertanding-ServiceProvider)\r\n- [The Injection Process](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/The-Injection-Process)\r\n- [Provinding Services](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Providing-Services)\r\n  - [Automatically](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Providing-Services:-Automatically-Way)\r\n  - [Manually](https://github.com/Skullabs/tRip/wiki/Providing-Services:-Manually-Way)\r\n\r\n### License\r\ntRip is Apache 2.0 licensed.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
